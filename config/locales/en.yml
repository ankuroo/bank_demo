# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#

# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      why_us_html: <p>CSB is a brand-new bank so why should you trust us over so many well-established banks.
        </p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>We are a bank that will never lose your money. We have an infinity pool of money and so we can never
                go bankrupt.</li>
            <li>We offer great security. We follow a two-factor authentication system which uses a login system so
                that your information and money is always secure.</li>
            <li>We understand what people want, so we are building a system that requires no paperwork whatsoever. This
                means less time will be spent on admins reading contracts and more on processing your requests.</li>
            <li>We are completely online. We have no branches and no cards. Through this method, we operate at no cost,
                which means we are dedicated to delivering the best service we can without running into any financial
                issues.</li>
        </ol>

                Please note that this is <strong>NOT</strong> a real bank and your money not transferrable
                to or from accounts of other banks. <br>
                CBS is not accountable for any false sense of wealth you may believe you have whilst using this site.
                <br><br>
                Any cards you have on this site, will not be delivered to you and there are no branches where they can
                be picked up. This is because they <strong>DO NOT EXIST</strong>. <br>
                Do NOT use the account details (Account No, Sort-Code or CVC) provided by CSB to make
                any real-world purchases on any site outside of this one. These transactions will not go through. <br>
                Do NOT list your CBS card details anywhere.
